# Java Web Crawler

### 📝 About the project
- This project was was the result of my studies about process synchronization (threads).
- Based on a Producer–consumer problem where a shared buffer needed to be protected from concurrent processes.
- The final result was a web crawler that download all images from a list of websites which all processes are synchronized by a binary semaphore.
